Tobias Lutke took a snowboarding trip in his ealry 20s to a ski resort outside of Vancouver, falling in love with the sport. He moved there one year later to pursue the sport and be with his then girlfriend, now wife. Through his girlfried, he met Scott Lake. Tobias and Scott attempted to open an online store for snowboarding equipment in 2004 called Snowdevil. Frustrated by existing e-commerce products available to build the online store, Tobias, a computer programmer, decided to build his own e-commerce platform. Using open source web application framework, Ruby on Rails, Tobias built Snowdevil's online store after two months of development. Recognising that many others would be facing the problems he faced in finding a suitable e-commerce platform, him and Scott launched Shopify in 2006 to address these problems.

Before approaching venture capitalists, Tobias turned to local Toronto based angel investor, John Phillips for intital capital raisings. In 2007, John invested $250k with Shopify having a valuation of $3 million then. In 2009, John invested a further $500k and joined the board of directors. Since launching their shopping cart function in 2007, Shopify had a net combined total of $100 million in sales by 2009. In 2010, they raised their first series A round of funding for $7 million and one year later in 2011, they raised a series B round of $15 million.

By 2012, Shopify was processing $740 million worth of sales with 40,000 stores using the e-commerce platform across 90 countries, taking a 2.9% +$0.30 transaction fee and charging three tiers of monthy subscriptions.

In 2013, Shopify conducted a series C round of fundraising of $100 million. This enabled Shopify to scale to process 100,000 stores and employ 500 people.

In 2015, Shopify went public with a valuation of $1.3 billion and raised $131 million. Tobias, who held 6.7% of the company in 2015 became a billionare.

In the most recent quarterly report (Q3, 2020), Shopify reported revenue of $977 million with a share price that has surged 4,600% since its IPO in 2015. Shares were then priced at $17 USD in May 2015 and are currently trading for $848 USD.

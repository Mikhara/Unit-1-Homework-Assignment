* Who are the founders of the company?

Tobias Lutke - co-founder and current CEO

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Tobias Lutke took a snowboarding trip in his ealry 20s to a ski resort outside of Vancouver, falling in love with the sport. He moved there one year later to pursue the sport and be with his then girlfriend, now wife. Through his girlfried, he met Scott Lake. Tobias and Scott attempted to open an online store for snowboarding equipment in 2004 called Snowdevil. Frustrated by existing e-commerce products available to build the online store, Tobias, a computer programmer, decided to build his own e-commerce platform. Using open source web application framework, Ruby on Rails, Tobias built Snowdevil's online store after two months of development. Recognising that many others would be facing the problems he faced in finding a suitable e-commerce platform, him and Scott launched Shopify in 2006 to address these problems.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Before approaching venture capitalists, Tobias turned to local Toronto based angel investor, John Phillips for intital capital raisings. In 2007, John invested $250k with Shopify having a valuation of $3 million then. In 2009, John invested a further $500k and joined the board of directors. Since launching their shopping cart function in 2007, Shopify had a net combined total of $100 million in sales by 2009. In 2010, they raised their first series A round of funding for $7 million and one year later in 2011, they raised a series B round of $15 million.

By 2012, Shopify was processing $740 million worth of sales with 40,000 stores using the e-commerce platform across 90 countries, taking a 2.9% +$0.30 transaction fee and charging three tiers of monthy subscriptions.

In 2013, Shopify conducted a series C round of fundraising of $100 million. This enabled Shopify to scale to process 100,000 stores and employ 500 people.

In 2015, Shopify went public with a valuation of $1.3 billion and raised $131 million. Tobias, who held 6.7% of the company in 2015 became a billionare.

In the most recent quarterly report (Q3, 2020), Shopify reported revenue of $977 million with a share price that has surged 4,600% since its IPO in 2015. Shares were then priced at $17 USD in May 2015 and are currently trading for $848 USD.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Shopify's earliest beginnings was as an online store itself, called Snowdevil to sell snowboards online in 2004. In 2006, Shopify began to transform into being an e-commerce platform. Founder Tobias Lutke was frustrated with existing e-commerce platforms and wanted to build something easy to use. Today, Shopify positions itself as - 
>"empowering anyone, anywhere to start a business."

The problem Shopify solves is from the start of a business journey with 1,000s of articles and how to guides on the Shopify blog to providing the the ability to sell, market and manage online.

The specific financial problem Shopify solves is providing a 
>"one stop shop" 
to create and customise an online store, accept payments over web, mobile, social media, brick and mortar shops and manage products, inventory and shipping all on the one e-commerce platform. Importantly, Shopify also offers its store users access to data analytics on who their customers are.

Previously, e-commerce stores had to use a variety of products from wordpress for a website, stripe for payments, sendle for shipping, google analytics for marketing analysis and so forth. The problem Shopify solves is bringing this all into one e-commerce platform that streamlines and makes the process more accessible.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Shopify's intended customer is anyone, anywhere wanting to start a business. Specifically, Shopify's target market is a person/company wanting to sell online via an e-commerce platform and wants to manage the process from start to finish in one place.

In the US alone, the e-commerce market has grown 44% in last year, during a global pandemic, with consumers spending $861 billion with US merchants. Noting that Amazon still has the lion share of this spending.

There are now an estimated 12-24 million ecommerce sites worldwide and it is estimated that by 2040, 95% of all purchases will be done online, with the ecommerce industry growing by 23% each year. Importantly, it is estimated that in 2020, ecommerce stores lost $756 million in sales due to poor ecommerce processes - this is the market Shopify targets by empowering stores to create easy online experiences for their customers.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

There are an estimated 370 ecommerce platforms with well known names such as the ecommerce giants Amazon and Alibaba to widely used ecommerce companies such as Wix, Squarespace and GoDaddy in Australia. 
* What sets shopify apart is the following:
  	* Value for money: Shopify is the cheapest value for money with their lowest subscription of Shopify Lite at $9USD/month offering the Shopify Pay function that can be integrated with a free Facebook Shop.
  	* No coding: Shopify enables online store creation, payment receival and management of inventory and customer marketing with no coding required. For those who want to specialise features, coding is available.
  	* Third Party apps: Shopify empowers developers to write add-ins and apps to personalise a user's store.
  	* Shopify blog: Shopify spends a lot of money on building a community of users sharing problems and solutions on its blog community, enagling the solution to user problems to be quickly found and applied.
  	* Shopify offers 70 payment gateways in more than 50 languages, much more options than its competitors by effectively partnering with payment companies in a range of countries.
  	* Unlimited bandwidth and storage enabling efficient loading speeds on web and mobile.
  	* Partnerships - in 2017, Shopify offered an intergration with Amazon that would allow Shopify stores to sell on Amazon from their stores. Shopify then acquired Oberlo, one of its third party apps, to enable Shopify stores to drop ship to consumers. In 2019, Shopify partnered with Snapchat to offer Shopify stores the ability to sell via Snapchat to Snapchat's 347 million active monthly users.


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Since first being built on Ruby on Rails, Shopify now uses dozens of technologies to operate. This are displayed from Stackshare below:
